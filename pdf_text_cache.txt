Computer Security Act of 1987 
Requires:
• Sensitive systems and data 
must be identified
• Plans for ensuring security 
and control of such 
systems must be created
• Personnel training 
programs must be 
developed and in placeDevelopment of Security 
Program
• Objectives
• Policies
• Connectivity, Corporate Structure, and 
Security
• Plans
• ResponsibilitiesSecurity Policy Goals
• Avoidance
• Deterrence
• Detection
• Correction
Risk Analysis
• Identify sensitivity of data
• Determine value of systems and information
• Assess threats and vulnerabilities (sabotage, 
environment, errors)
Purposes of Risk Analysis
• No significant intentional or accidental 
threat is overlooked
• Assure that cost-benefit analysis is 
reasonable
Contingency Plan
• Purpose: Protect, detect, recover
• Criticality: Formulated, communicated to 
ALL employees, tested regularlyLegal Issues
• Licenses
• Fraud/Misuse
• Privacy
• Copyright
• Trade Secrets
• Employee Agreements
Access Control
Collection of mechanisms to restrain 
or prohibit use of information and 
systems
Includes: Functions, implementation, 
good practices, environmental 
constraints
Considerations
• Ownership of Data
• Custodian of Data
• Accountability
• Reconciliation
• Rule of Least Privilege

Password Management

Cryptography
Definition: Use of secret codes to 
provide integrity/confidentiality 
of information during transfer 
and storage
Considerations:
-Complexity
-Secrecy
- Characteristics of key
Definition:
Encryption: plaintext to 
ciphertext
Decryption: From ciphertext to 
plaintext
Key Management
• Public vs. Private
• Selecting Key
• Management of the Keys
• Protection of Keys
• Testing of Keys
• Updating Keys
• Error Detection
Risk Management
Includes ideas, models, methods, 
techniques to control risk
Includes:
-Assessment
-Reduction
-Protective measures
-Risk Acceptance
-Insurance
Considerations of Risk 
Assessment

• Exposure
• Passive Threats
• Perils
• Prevention
• Analysis/Assessment/Management of Risk
• Data Valuation 
Classification of People/Assets 
Should Include:
-People
-Procedures
-Data/Information
-Software
-Hardware
Threat and Exposure Assessment
• Density/V olume of Information
• Accessibility of Systems
• Complexity
• Electronic Vulnerability
• Media Vulnerability

Safeguards and Counter 
Measures
• Prevent Exposures

• Correct the Causes of Threats
Business Continuity Planning (1)
• Planning and Analysis Methods
• Rates of Occurrence of Disabling Events
• Availability and Use of Planning Tools/Aids
• Identification of Business Success 
factors(BSF) and Critical 
capabilities(Critical or Key Success Factors 
(CSF/KSF)
Business Continuity Planning (2)
• Alternative Sources of Supply
• Legal and Regulatory Requirements
Backups and Procedures
• Importance for Recovery
• Data Value
• Manuals and Documentation
• Back Up Frequency
• On-Line Systems
• Equipment
The Three C’s
-Catastrophe
-Contingency
-Continuation
BE PREPARED!!!
Off-site Backups and Storage
Two Control Points:
1. When backup material is being 
transferred to/from the site
2. When backup material is stored at 
the site
(also consider in-house storage)
Data Classification
